# @types/steem-js-alpha
Typescript definitions for steem-js library.

### Warning

This types are an aplha release. We have spent some time in writing declarations for various steem-js functions.
Responses from steem are complex, and writing type definitions for them takes a lot of time. Our goal is to prepare complete type definitions for all functions and responses of steem-js lib. Typescript lovers - stay tuned! :D
When they are finished, we will rename the package to `@types/steem-js`;

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev @types/steem-js-alpha
```
